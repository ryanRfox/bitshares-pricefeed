        # * Sin wave modulation of bitUSD (Ranges from $0.86 to $1.14 throughout the month via the 14% amplitude).

        # New HERTZ assets could be created with different periods, amplitudes and wave formulas. Increasing the period and reducing the amplitude would make a more stable HERTZ ABA, where as decreasing the period and increasing the amplitude would result in a more volatile HERTZ ABA.
